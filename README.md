# eo-pyping
Ping some hosts and see if they respond

## Usage
This program accepts an arbitrary number of things to go out and ping. Call it as such:
```
python3 pyping_eo.py site1.com 1.2.3.4 hostname my.fully.qualified.domain.name
```

## Future work
* Accept other options (such as how many times to retry before considering a host down)
* Print out results after the pings are done
